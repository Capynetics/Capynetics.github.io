If you are studing about mobile robots I recommend you take a look at my [online path-planning algorithms simulator](https://capynetics.github.io/assets/pathsim/) where you can test different path-planning algorithms in different scenarios. The algorithms available are:

- bug0
- bug1
- bug2
- wavefront
- RRT

After selecting one of the available algorithms in the first dropdown menu, select a scene in the second dropdown. Then, click and drag the robot (white ball) and the target (red ball) to de desired positions. When everything is set up just click the start button a see how the robot will get to the target using the desired algorithm.

For more information on the algorithm used in the simulator, I suggest the excellent book [Principles of Robot Motion](https://www.amazon.com.br/Principles-Robot-Motion-Algorithms-Implementations/dp/0262033275).

This website was my final project for a class on mobile robots I took during my electrical engineering degree. If you also want to see the robotics simulator I developed as my final year thesis look [here](https://uaibot.github.io/).
