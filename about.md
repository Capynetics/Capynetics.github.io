This is a repository of ideas, most of them gravitate around STEM and geek culture. My objective here is to share thoughts and stimulate discussion around the subjects here approached. As a young millennial much of what I know and much of my identity were built in the world wide web, so, this site can be seen as both a way to retribute this brave world for its impact on me and try to more actively participate on it.
